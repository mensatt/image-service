# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to our project! To ensure a smooth process for both you and us, please take a moment to read this document - We appreciate it!

## Bugs and Issues

If you found a bug or have any other issue, feel free to open up an issue. Before opening the issue, please make sure a similar issue does not already exist - perhaps some else has already even resolved it?

### A good issue...

...should contain everything needed for someone else to investigate the issue. In particular, make sure that you

- are using the latest version
- have read the documentation
- use a descriptive title for your issue
- provide as much information as possible
- include steps to reproduce the issue (ideally)

## Enhancements

Similar to bugs and issues, we are happy to hear about your ideas for how we can improve our software. Again, please make sure someone else has not already suggested a similar feature or improvement. As with bugs, make sure that the description of your enhancement is as precise as possible

Contributions to this repository follow the typical [GitHub workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow). The process roughly is as follows:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name based on `main`
3. Make your change(s)  
   Ideally, your commits should contain isolated and complete changes and use [conventional commit style](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for their messages.
4. Publish your branch (in your fork)
5. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/mensatt/image-service/compare) from your branch to `main`
6. Request a review from someone with write access
7. Merge your branch once an approving review was given

If your branch has became outdated, please use rebasing to update it to the current commit of `main`.  
A tutorial of how to do that can be found [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/git_rebase.html). If you are stuck, feel free to ask for help in your PR.
